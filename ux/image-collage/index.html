<p>
  Collaging is a projective technique by which participants select images that represent how they feel about a particular topic. 
  The participants then explain to the moderator the reason they chose each image. 
  The collage becomes an instrument through which participants are able to express needs and feelings that they might not otherwise have been able to articulate.

  In this assignment, I perform a image collage to examine the application and granting process of a staff benefit at a past employer.
