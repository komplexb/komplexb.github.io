The Interaction Design capstone project was a collaborative effort between myself and two other 
group members. We drew on the experiences of a team member who worked at Baltimore's <a href="http://www.creativealliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Creative Alliance</a> and participated in their KERPLUNK after-school program. 
From her experiences the group theorised that we could improve the experiences of the young attendees by 
designing an augmented reality app powered by Google Glass.

Our investigations into enhancing the exhibition experience revealed prior research centered around museum visitors. 
We speculated that the behavior of museum visitors could be comparative to that of our young KERPLUNK visitors, 
and leaned heavily on findings about the way in which patrons traverse a museum. 
The roles below served as thin personas that helped drive ideation for our designs within the constraints of 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/design/principles" target="_blank" rel="external">Glass Design principles</a>: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ANT - visitors who follow a specific path and spend a lot of time observing almost all the exhibits.</li>
  <li>FISH - visitors who move most of the times in the center of the room without looking at exhibit's details.</li>
  <li>BUTTERFLY - visitors who don't follow a specific path, are guided by the physical orientation of the exhibits and stop frequently examining their details.</li>
  <li>GRASSHOPPER - visitors whose visit contains specific pre-selected exhibits, and spend a lot of time observing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the absence of a actual Glass device, we utilized a variation of the Wizard of Oz technique to facilitate our design tests. </p>
