<p>Tasked with researching and designing a Budgeting application for a underserved user group, I selected individuals with Down syndrome.</p>
<p>Down syndrome (DS) is a disorder that manifests itself in disabilities that affect all three major types of capabilities (cognitive, motor, and perceptual).</p>
<p>From my research I was able to glean a set of tenets to guide interface design for this audience. This includes: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Aid with distinguishing and understanding.</li>
	<li>Aid with interaction.</li>
	<li>Aid with navigation and finding content.</li>
	<li>Provide clear guidance, feedback and rewards. </li>
	<li>Don't underestimate the impact of images.</li>
	<li>Remember that everything means something.</li>
</ul>
<p>My findings and resulting prototype are available below. </p>
