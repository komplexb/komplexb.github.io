<p>
    A contextual inquiry is a technique utilized for user and task analysis; it attempts to answer two questions:<br>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>What matters to people about their process?</li>
    <li>How should we respond?</li>
</ol>

<p>
  In this assignment, I perform a contextual inquiry to examine the application and granting process of a staff benefit at a previous employer.
