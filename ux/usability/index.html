    A usability test begins with the recruitment of test participants who represent a target audience. 
    The participants are observed while interacting with a product/service to evaluate the degree to which it meets specific usability criteria.

<p>
  In this assignment, I perform usability tests on a grades management software used by a few local high schools.

In general, I found that out of the box task success is not a strength of the application, 
i.e. documentation review prior to initial use is crucial to user success. 
Going into this test, I assumed an ugly app meant it was also unusable. 
Ultimately this perspective was disproved by users exhibiting expert use of the app during testing.
