title: SourceTree - the tool that gives me fuzzies

On the SourceTree website, Atlassian makes an audacious claim about their tool; get all the power of Git, without the command line.

> Say goodbye to the command line - use the full capability of Git in the SourceTree desktop app.  -- [SourceTree][1]

I have no intention of trying to validate their claim, instead I want to share two moment's when using SourceTree made me feel warm and fuzzy inside.  

## Scenario 1 - Gitflow  
The project team decided to use the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) pattern to manage our repository. Following this decision was a set of instructions for us to install a Gitflow tool at the command line to make things easier for us. As it would turn out, the instructions required Homebrew, so that's two (hassle-free) installs. Just as I was about to start my feature I noticed something I hadn't seen before, despite how many times I've clicked the "Terminal" icon right next to it.

I suspect I only noticed it because the term "Git Flow" now held meaning for me. Nevertheless SourceTree delighted me as a user with the integration of a tool I never knew I needed.

## Scenario 2 - SourceTree Custom Actions  
I had asked a colleague how to use multiple git authors on a single workstation, because all my commits to personal projects were showing up as being done by my work account. He pointed me to an article about [project specific git authors](http://www.codeography.com/2011/08/05/project-specific-git-author.html). This was the exact solution for my problem, however I wanted to be able to toggle authors with one click. At first I thought a shell script would be the best way to achieve this, but then I remembered SourceTree's custom actions in the preferences dialog. After a bit of fiddling I was able to set up shortcut keys that performed this task for me.

Once again SourceTree gave me the fuzzies with a feature thatâ€™s always been there, but whose value I didn't know until I tried it.
