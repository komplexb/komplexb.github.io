                        It's Sunday morning, each week I check the interwebs for remote jobs. I hop onto weworkremotely.com and start scrolling down. Wait, back up, what was that highlighted at the top? Basecamp, THE Basecamp is looking for a Product Designer and I almost missed it! *frantically clicks link*. Would they consider a design noob?

                        Great! No disheartening years of experience listed, there is hope yet. But how will I impress them? Perhaps <a target='_blank' href="http://www.signalvnoise.com/posts/1748-forget-the-resume-kill-on-the-cover-letter">kill on the cover letter</a> with honesty and the absence of hubris.

                    Good Day folks, I recently completed a four course Graduate Certificate in Information Design; the syllabus has exposed me to the disciplines of Humans Computers &amp; Cognition, Information Architecture, User Research, and Interface &amp; Interaction Design. Perhaps I can garner your interest in offering me my first design job.

                    <p>
                        In my understanding, UI Design should be influenced by established best practices, user research and trends of the day. Once I've gathered data on my audience I now have a context to determine flows and overall layout while iterating against best practices, trends and user testing. Here are some examples of how I approach interface design:<br>

                      <p>
                       I consider my self a user advocate. I noticed this from the type of questions I asked when discussing applications among friends. If a colleague shared an application idea, I would first ask about the application's utility to his target user or the nebulous "average man"; are you trying to solve a problem, or make something cool? If a friend wanted feedback about an interface I would try to dissect it, not just take the interface as is, but try to consider its efficacy in the various contexts. I also like the process of task analysis as a means of learning user motivations and figuring out what user's are trying to achieve and how to simplify that process.<br>

<p>I've found that Clay Christensen's jobs model resonates with my thoughts on product design. In this model, users/customers "hire" products to do "jobs" for them. As a designer I can then ask the user to fill in the blanks in the statement below.

                        Having been employed as a Front-end Developer for the last 3 years, I've completed work for companies such as AutoZone, NAPA Auto Parts and David's Bridal. Project details are available in my résumé <a href='#resume-section' title='View Résumé Below'>below</a>.

                        I got into design to find out how design professionals created interfaces. I thought it was all about gut feeling and talent,  colours and typography. I soon found that there was more to design; that it had various facets that could accommodate both the generative designer and the designer who excels in synthesis. Design theory intrigued me, from discovering that visual design is distinctly different from interaction design, to learning how interfaces can cause cognitive overload.

                  <p>
                    I am responsible for the construction and maintenance of web pages for both internal and external projects. I work with the UX team to maintain the integrity of the visual and interaction designs during development and/or implementation. Project tasks include markup development for client implementation, as well as UI development for Java and ASP.NET web and mobile-web applications. Major projects include: <br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>CAFM</b> (<a target='_blank' href='http://cafmuseum.techno-science.ca'>cafmuseum.techno-science.ca</a>) - 	The Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation (CSTMC) provided mockups to be developed for their suite of websites. An adaptive website implementation was recommended to the client. As the supporting Front-end Developer, I implemented markup consistent with the breakpoints as well as various JavaScript plugins that ensured the page elements rendered correctly on mobile devices.   
                        </li>
                         <li>
                            <b>ICMA-RC</b> – Fixed layout, markup development for internal use, utilizing HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery plugins from Bootstrap. Provided cross browser compatibility for dominant web browsers and backward compatibility starting from IE7. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Autozone Mobile</b> (<a target='_blank' href='http://m.autozone.com'>m.autozone.com</a>) – Client provided a style guide and a few pages from which I derived new pages and modules to implement in a Java web application. Tasks included HTML5 and CSS3 markup, JavaScript development, jQuery and AJAX interactions. I was also tasked with ensuring UI and interaction consistency across mobile devices with various screen resolutions and pixel densities. Compatibility was required for iOS browsers, stock browsers for Android OS 2.2 and later, Firefox for Android as well as Internet Explorer for Windows Phone 7.5 and later.
                        </li>

                            <b>GPC/NAPA Auto Parts</b> – This project began as fixed layout markup development for internal use, utilizing HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery UI. I was later required to implement this UI on an ASP.NET web forms back end. Cross browser compatibility for dominant web browsers and backward compatibility starting from IE7 was required.
