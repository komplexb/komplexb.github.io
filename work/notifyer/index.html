Notifyer is a proof of concept solution to a problem I’ve been thinking about for a long time. Namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do I get a daily quote from my curated collection?</li>
  <li>How can I effortlessly resurface a buried quote so I can re-apply it’s inspiration and lessons to the present?</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Microsoft’s OneNote as a datastore, Notifyer utilizes OneNote’s API to retrieve notes from a given section. A note is then selected to be pushed to your devices via Pushbullet’s API.</p>

<p>The ideal use case is to schedule Notifyer’s random method to be invoked periodically, perhaps as a <a href="assets/img/work/notifyer/zapier.png" target="_blank">Zapier App</a>.<br />
Notifyer is still under development.</p>
