At RealDecoy I performed Front-end Development for ecommerce clients running Oracle Endeca Commerce (OEC). 
OEC web applications were primarily developed in Java, which gave me the opportunity to work with JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) as I integrated styles. 
I was also tasked with equipping a few back-end developers with basic front-end development techniques.
