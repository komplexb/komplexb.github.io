<p>At RealDecoy I performed Front-end Development for e-commerce clients running Oracle Endeca Commerce (OEC). 
Since OEC web applications were primarily developed with Spring MVC, I primarily worked with JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) 
and occasionally did light back-end development to manipulate and expose data to be used on the Front-end. 
I was also tasked with equipping a few back-end developers with basic front-end development techniques.
