It soon became apparent that I might as well collate these thoughts and observations and send them off to Microsoft, in the hopes that someone is listening."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:w,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Discontented observationalism is the designer’s modus operandi.

By showing information, it elicits a desire to view\u002Finteract with the information. The thing is live tiles aren't matching a reasonable mental model that some people have for it. Here is a model that could increase the utility of the feature: tile content should deep link to the content it previews; if the People app shows me a friend's status update, when I click it it should bring me to that friend's status so I can see all of it and comment. This mental model is not unique to me as a techie\u002Fdeveloper\u002Fdesigner; recently my mother was using my Surface for the first time, she saw a photo of her self and my father slide up on the Photos tile, she wanted to see it so she quickly tapped it, of course this simply launched the Photos  app, but to her dismay, it didn't show her photo, she had to look for it buried as it was in the camera roll of 1600+ photos. Defaulting the \"open\" behavior to load \"last seen tile content\" would of course disrupt the mental model of other users who simply want to open a particular app, so how can we facilitate both?

Here's a scenario: I posted some family photos to SkyDrive, mom and I are reviewing them on the Surface, she want's me to print some. I swipe through the photos and she tells me which one she wants to print, but I have no easy way to collate them, I resort to taking screenshots of each one she likes.

Usually a bit of the content outside the current viewport is displayed to indicate that there is more content horizonally or vertically, however this behavior is not consistent with the share charm.
